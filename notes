INDEX.JS CODE UNDERSTANDING 
index.js contains our main code, it's work is to take our react app (Tic tac toe) and show it inside a particular part of the web page 
import { StrictMode } from "react"; - here strictmode is a tool which removes any bugs and unsafe practices in the project. It's basically importing strictmode from react. 
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client"; - createroot creates a place in html where we can display our react project (tic tac toe) and react-dom is a react library 
which allows react to connect with the actual webpage.So createroot function is comes from the react dom library to help display the tictactoe on the webpage.
import "./styles.css"; - CCS (cascading style sheets) it's work is to describe how our html webpage will look. This command helps us with the font, colour, size, etc of the webpage.
import App from "./App";- There's another file app.js which contains the code of the app so this command brings in that "app" main component where our app starts from app.js. 
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("Ikshita")); - (document.getElementById("Ikshita")) this part search ups the html file of the app and finds out the ID named Ikshita
the command in the html file look like <div id="Ikshita"></div> also here div means an empty box in our web page, createroot it's a react function from react dom library it creates
a root which means a workspace in the page and make progress of the app. 
root.render- root-is the contoller of ID Ikshita, render- it's work is to put our app into the Ikshita div. Basically root.render command is used to take the react app components 
and display on the Ikshita div that we created earlier.


APP.JS MAIN CODE UNDERSTANDING
import { useState } from 'react'; - usestate is again a function from react it helps us to remember moves and whose turn it is in a game like tic tac toe. 
function Square({ value, onSquareClick }) { - this command creates a component sqaure, this accepts informationpassed to it, onsquareclick is a functions that runs when it's clicked 
and then what function to call and function like switch player ( X or O in the tic tac toe game ). 
return (
  <button className="square" onClick={onSquareClick}>
    {value}
  </button>
); 
under the tag classname="sqaure" we can style it with css change font, size, colour etc. onClick={onSquareClick} it basically call the function when clicked like on clicking 
a square we might get an X or O in a game of tic tac toe. {value} - what value is stored again like X or O. Also here button is like a clickable button which will work and through
value when clicked, the square has these buttons.
